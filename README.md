# ⚡️ SolderX
>Fuse, Flatten & Forge Solidity Contracts <br/>

**Lightweight Solidity source flattener tool & dependency resolver.**

SolderX is a developer-first Solidity flattener that handles local files, project folders, and verified contracts from blockchain explorers. Explorer sources are resolved directly from the API response and flattened on the fly, without requiring the source tree to be saved locally first.

It handles nested and relative imports, remappings, SPDX normalization,
topological dependency ordering, import deduplication, and cyclic
dependency detection.

Built for Solidity developers, researchers, auditors, and security
tooling — including source verification, audits, and static analysis.

## Installation
```bash
pip install solderx
```
**SolderX** is now available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/solderx/) — install it in seconds and start soldering Solidity contracts effortlessly.
>**✅ Requirements:** Python **3.8+**
 

---
## Why use SolderX ? :
**SolderX** takes care of everything:

- ✅ Flatten a single file, entire project folder, or verified solidity contracts from explorers (like Etherscan)
- ✅ Supports remappings, relative imports, and handles complex cyclic dependencies
- ✅ Fully in-memory parsing — no `.sol` clutter or manual cleanup from explorer downloads

> One powerful CLI + Python tool — clean, audit-ready output in seconds.

Most flatteners break on remappings, folder imports, or explorer parsings — **SolderX** doesn't.

>**⚡️ SolderX** brings file, folder, and verified explorer flattening together in a single lightweight interface


---

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Simple file
solderx MyContract.sol

# Simple file with output path
solderx MyContract.sol --output MyContract_Flat.sol

# With remappings
solderx path/to/Contract.sol -r remappings.json
```
```bash
# Project folder with inline remapping
solderx src/ --remappings "@a=lib/a,@b=node_modules/b"

# With a remappings json
solderx project/contracts --remappings remappings.json

# With remappings and output filepath
solderx path/to/project/ -r remappings.json -o flattened/soldered_project.sol
```
```bash
# fetch from etherscan 
solderx 0xAbC...123 -chain eth --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# also fetch from etherscan 
solderx eth:0xAbC...123 --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

```

## Python API Usage
```python
from solderx import solder_file, solder_folder, solder_scan

# 🔹 1. Flatten a single file
flattened_code = solder_file("path/to/Contract.sol")

# With remappings
flattened_code = solder_file("path/to/Contract.sol", remappings={"@oz": "lib/openzeppelin-contracts"})


# 🔹 2. Flatten an entire folder
flattened_code = solderx("contracts/")

# With remappings
flattened_code = solder_file("path/to/Contract.sol", remappings={"@oz": "lib/openzeppelin-contracts"})


# 🔹 3. Flatten from verified explorer source

# Flatten from Etherscan
flattened_code = solderx("0x123..789", chain = 'eth')

flattened_code = solderx("eth:0x123..789")


# 🔹 save file (default = False)
_ = solder_file("path/to/Contract.sol", save_file=True)

# save file in specified path
_ = solder_file("path/to/Contract.sol", output_path='./Contract_Flat.sol')
```

---

## Real Use Cases

- **Re-verify** contracts on Etherscan after audits or refactors
- **Feed single files** into static analyzers like Slither, Mythril, Semgrep
- **Compare bytecode** outputs between flattened and deployed versions
- **Onboard contributors** by flattening large repos for easier reading
- **Pipeline-ready** for CI/CD - security scans, or deployment packaging
